# Welding with Electricity

A hands-on introduction to gas tungsten arc welding \(GTAW\), commonly called TIG welding \(tungsten + inert gas\). It isnâ€™t as scary as it sounds. If you can solder, you can weld and braze. Plus tons of resources to continue learning on your own.

This class will include in-person, hands-on practice welding \(adhering to COVID-19 social distancing regulations\) with live video demonstrations and additional online resources.

In this class you will learn:

* Fundamental concepts of welding, cutting, and brazing
* Different types of welding processes used in industry
* Basic metallurgy and material properties
* Proper safety attire and safe working practices

In this class you will practice:

* Arc welding carbon steel using the GTAW process
* Spot welding thin sheet metal using resistance welding
* Proper equipment set up & maintenance
* Welding safety: prevention & emergency handling

Equipment used:

* Miller Multimatic 220 AC/DC welder
* Miller Model 11 Lectro Spot welder
* Autodarkening helmets

Please wear long sleeves and pants made of natural fibers or leather, with boots or closed-toe leather shoes. Also recommended is a cap, bandana, or hair covering.  FCFL will provide welding helmets, welding gloves, safety glasses, face shields, and ear protection when needed.

All students will be required to attend a safety orientation and sign a checklist signifying that they have received and understand the safety requirements before participating in welding activities.
